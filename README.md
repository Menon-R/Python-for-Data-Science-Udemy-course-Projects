# Python-for-Data-Science-Udemy-course-Projects
Projects done on python from the Udemy course for Data Science using python.

The projetcs are listed below with a description of the project and steps in which it was solved. The python file .ipynb is also made availabe in each project folder.

## [Project - 1](https://github.com/Menon-R/Python-for-Data-Science-Udemy-course-Projects/blob/master/Project%20-1%20Law%20of%20Large%20Numbers)

**Law of Large Numbers (LLN)**

A probabilty theorem to prove that as the sample size grows, the mean gets closer to the average of the population. This principle can be used in *Risk management*, where if the amount of exposure to losses increases, then the predicted loss gets closer to the actual loss. Whereas in a *financial context*, it states that a larger entitiy that is growing rapidly cannot maintain its growth pace forever.

## [Project - 2](https://github.com/Menon-R/Python-for-Data-Science-Udemy-course-Projects/blob/master/Project%20-2%20Financial%20Statement%20Analysis)

**Financial Statement Analysis**

Analysisng the given data of financial statemenet for decion-making purpose. In this we calculate the net profit for each month alsong with profit after tax and profit margin.

## [Project - 3](https://github.com/Menon-R/Python-for-Data-Science-Udemy-course-Projects/tree/master/Project%20-3%20Basketball%20Trends)

**Basketball Trends**

The data for analysing top five players from year 2014-2019, before the start of the pandmic. Soruce for the data is Wikipedia and Hoopshype and the player salary, minutes played and points are considered for our visualizations. Using pylpot libraray from the matplotlib and the numpy packages, the visualizataions created can be used to understand player performance.
