## [Project - 1](Python-for-Data-Science-Udemy-course-Projects/Project -1 Law of Large Numbers/readme1.md)

**Law of Large Numbers (LLN)**

A probabilty theorem to prove that as the sample size grows, the mean gets closer to the average of the population. This principle can be used in *Risk management*, where if the amount of exposure to losses increases, then the predicted loss gets closer to the actual loss. Whereas in a *financial context*, it states that a larger entitiy that is growing rapidly cannot maintain its growth pace forever.
